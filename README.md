### No. 2: F1 VIP fan hyper-realistic selfie edit

![Language-EN](https://img.shields.io/badge/Language-EN-blue)
![Raycast](https://img.shields.io/badge/🚀-Raycast_Friendly-purple)

#### 📖 Description

An extensive prompt for transforming a user’s selfie into an 8K hyper-realistic photo of them as a stylish F1 fan at a premium automotive event, preserving their real face while changing outfit and setting.

#### 📝 Prompt

```
Create a hyper-realistic 8K image that keeps my real face, features, skin color, eyes, and hair exactly as in the reference image.
I am the {argument name="subject_gender_role_en" default="woman"} in the photo; preserve my confident, charming, and elegant expression, with a slight smile and relaxed posture.
Place me at an outdoor automotive event, in a grandstand or VIP box, with a wide view of the track and the crowd in the background. The weather is sunny, with an intense blue sky and natural sunlight that enhances the colors and creates a vibrant racing atmosphere.
Use a medium-shot framing, capturing the upper body and the busy background with a slight depth-of-field blur.
The outfit is sporty yet sophisticated, consisting of:
 * A {argument name="cap_brand_en" default="Red Ferrari"} cap, with the yellow prancing horse (cavallino rampante) logo on the front and the number "{argument name="driver_number_en" default="16"}" in white on the brim;
 * A strapless structured denim top, tight with visible stitching, emphasizing the neckline and silhouette;
 * {argument name="sunglasses_brand_en" default="Miu Miu"} sunglasses with brown gradient lenses and a rectangular metallic frame, partially covering the eyes;
 * A double necklace – one with large golden links and another with delicate diamonds close to the neck;
 * Geometric gold earrings;
 * A silver bracelet on the right wrist;
 * A discreet red bag hanging on the shoulder, partially visible beside the arm.
Hair is natural and loose.
Makeup is impeccable and glamorous, with glowy skin, defined eyes, pink lipstick, and warm blush.
Nails are long and decorated with nail art in shades of pink and red with white details, visible while holding the glass.
The pose should convey attitude and sophistication:
 * Right hand holding the brim of the cap, adjusting it slightly;
 * Left hand holding a glass of {argument name="drink_type_en" default="white wine"}, with the arm relaxed;
 * Body slightly leaned, face turned toward the camera.
Lighting is natural and intense, with subtle sun reflections on the face and hair.
Use a vibrant color palette – shades of red, denim blue, gold, and caramel, contrasted with the sunny background.
The overall atmosphere is modern, luxurious, and relaxed, expressing the lifestyle of someone who enjoys exclusive experiences, with elegance and a strong presence at a premium automotive event.
Quality: 8K hyper-realistic photo, sharp focus on the face and outfit, background slightly blurred with a colorful crowd and the track in the sun.
Important:
 * Keep my face, hair, and skin color original.
 * Preserve the authentic p

Light the scene with soft, diffused multi-source lighting, creating subtle shadows, neutral color balance, and crisp focus across the entire frame. Show highly detailed real-world materials (metal, plastic, rubber grips, circuit boards, screws). For every part, add a thin white rectangular frame and a short, sharp English label in clean sans-serif text, placed next to the component without covering it; annotations must be legible but unobtrusive.

### No. 8: Swiss alpine winter portrait of a young man

![Language-EN](https://img.shields.io/badge/Language-EN-blue)
![Raycast](https://img.shields.io/badge/🚀-Raycast_Friendly-purple)

#### 📖 Description

A rich prompt for an ultra-detailed DSLR-style portrait of a young man in a snowy Swiss alpine village during winter evening, with cinematic lighting and shallow depth of field.

#### 📝 Prompt

```
Hyper-realistic, ultra-detailed DSLR cinematic portrait of a young man (same facial identity as the reference) standing outdoors in a {argument name="location_en" default="Swiss alpine village"} during a winter evening. Soft snow is falling, with visible frosty breath in the cold air. His hands are in his pockets in a relaxed, natural stance.

He wears a thick wool winter coat, a textured knit sweater, and a loosely wrapped scarf, with a subtle accessory: a silver ring.

Background: snow-covered rooftops, blurred alpine mountains, glowing chalet windows, and warm village street lamps, with soft golden bokeh reflecting on the fresh snow.

Lighting: cinematic winter lighting that blends cool blue shadows with warm golden highlights. Rosy winter skin tones, sharp facial detail, shallow depth of field, and a touch of atmospheric haze.

Camera: 8K, full-frame DSLR, 85mm lens, f/1.8, ISO 100, 1/200s.
Style: editorial travel portrait, hyper-realism, high dynamic range, crisp focus, and natural skin texture.

### No. 12: Futuristic facial age-checker infographic portrait

![Language-EN](https://img.shields.io/badge/Language-EN-blue)
![Raycast](https://img.shields.io/badge/🚀-Raycast_Friendly-purple)

#### 📖 Description

A long, detailed prompt for creating a hyper-realistic portrait infographic that analyzes facial aging factors with overlays and labeled percentages, styled like a premium cosmetic-tech ad.

#### 📝 Prompt

```
A hyper-realistic, high-resolution portrait infographic based on ({argument name="reference_photo_en" default="your photo"}). Keep the same person, identity, hairstyle, clothing, and natural skin tone from ({argument name="reference_photo_short_en" default="your photo"}), with a neutral studio background. Overlay a subtle, semi-transparent facial analysis grid over the entire face, similar to a 3D face-scanning mesh: thin, soft white lines following the facial contours, slightly glowing but not hiding the skin details. Add one clean vertical red laser line running down one side of the face, like a futuristic scan. All analysis lines must be soft, minimal, and elegant, exactly like a cosmetic-tech advertisement.

Create a clean medical–aesthetic infographic that evaluates 5 aging factors using global data percentages:
1. Fine lines and wrinkles
2. Skin texture and elasticity
3. Facial volume and sagging
4. Eye area aging signs
5. Skin tone and pigmentation

For each factor, place a small label with a thin line pointing to the relevant facial area, and next to it write a short title and a realistic percentage score from 0–100% (based on global data), for example:
“Fine lines & wrinkles – 18%”
“Skin texture & elasticity – 72%”
“Facial volume & sagging – 35%”
“Eye area aging signs – 41%”
“Skin tone & pigmentation – 63%”

Use clean, modern sans-serif typography and small technical-style text, like a scientific facial analysis UI. At the bottom of the image, in the center, write a large bold text showing the final estimated real age based on the analysis, for example:
“ESTIMATED AGE: (random number based on face analysis)”

Overall style: futuristic AI-guided skincare analysis, minimalistic, premium editorial lighting, no gender specified, suitable for any human face.
```

### No. 18: Childlike crayon-style family camping drawing

![Language-KO](https://img.shields.io/badge/Language-KO-blue)
![Raycast](https://img.shields.io/badge/🚀-Raycast_Friendly-purple)

#### 📖 Description

A Korean prompt for turning only the drawing on a sheet of paper into a childlike crayon-style illustration of a family camping scene, while keeping the rest of the image unchanged. It’s meant for style-transfer or image-to-image use where the surrounding elements stay the same.

#### 📝 Prompt

```
Keep all other elements in the image exactly as they are, and change only the drawing on the sheet of paper to a different style.

The content of the drawing is a camping trip taken with a {argument name="vehicle_en" default="caravan"}. On the left, the two people are {argument name="left_characters_en" default="a mother and child"} sitting at a table, and on the right is {argument name="right_character_en" default="the father"} grilling meat using a {argument name="cooking_tool_en" default="barbecue grill"}.

Change the drawing into a style like an elementary school student’s crayon drawing.

![Language-EN](https://img.shields.io/badge/Language-EN-blue)
![Raycast](https://img.shields.io/badge/🚀-Raycast_Friendly-purple)

#### 📖 Description

A long, highly detailed image-generation specification describing a high-angle shot of an East Asian idol lying upside down in a cluttered closet, with fairy grunge styling, tattoos, and specific wardrobe and environment details. Best used when working with a reference pose image.

#### 📝 Prompt

```
High-angle bird's-eye view shot of a female East Asian idol subject lying on the floor of a cluttered closet, strictly following the upside-down pose and anatomical structure shown in {argument name="reference_image_en" default="image_0.png"}. She is wearing a rich blue lace-overlay mini dress with a milkmaid bodice, sweetheart neckline, cap sleeves, and a lettuce hem. She wears heavy, knee-high red leather boots with a vertical front seam. Visible tattoos include a barbed wire band on the thigh and small stick-and-poke heart and key motifs on the chest. The floor is covered in piles of mixed textiles, tulle, and clothing. The background walls are painted yellow, featuring white wire shelving, semi-transparent plastic storage drawers, and a packed clothing rack. Lighting is overhead tungsten, creating a warm sepia, vintage 90s disposable camera filter look. The mood is exhausted, messy, and romantically grunge.

Fairy grunge aesthetic, girl in a rich blue dress and red leather boots lying upside down in a cluttered closet with yellow walls, pose from {argument name="reference_image_short_en" default="image_0.png"}, sepia tone, high-angle shot.

Negative prompt: minimalism, clean floor, bright daylight, cold lighting, organized, empty space, modern furniture, neon colors, HD digital look, glossy finish, wide angle, fisheye, distorted limbs, missing tattoos, incorrect pose.

```
Generate a single photorealistic 16:9 image and split its composition into left and right halves. On each side, depict the same place,
[LOCATION_NAME: {argument name="location_name_en" default="(any location)"}],
at different eras.

Left side: {argument name="left_year_en" default="(any year)"} · {argument name="left_time_en" default="(time)"}
Right side: {argument name="right_year_en" default="(any year)"} · {argument name="right_time_en" default="(time)"}

Keep the camera position exactly the same and use the following coordinates:
[LATITUDE,LONGITUDE: {argument name="coordinates_en" default="(latitude and longitude of any place)"}]

Do not include any text in the image (years, labels, watermarks, etc.). Do not specify detailed visuals.
Leave all aspects such as architecture, light, cars, people, signs, materials, atmosphere, and composition up to Nano Banana Pro.

Each era should feel natural and together form a side-by-side time comparison image within a single 16:9 frame.

### No. 158: Annotated landmark images of Eiffel Tower, Great Wall, Colosseum, Taj Mahal

![Language-EN](https://img.shields.io/badge/Language-EN-blue)

#### 📖 Description

A multi-image prompt to generate four hyper-realistic landmark scenes with informative annotations overlaying key architectural and cultural details.

#### 📝 Prompt

```
Generate four distinct, hyper‑realistic images, each depicting a world‑renowned landmark. For each image, include a comprehensive and clearly legible set of annotations directly overlaid onto key architectural features, historical elements, or culturally significant details. These annotations should provide brief, informative descriptions.

The first image should feature the Eiffel Tower in Paris, France, at sunset, with annotations highlighting its iron lattice structure, observation decks, and historical significance.

The second image should showcase the Great Wall of China, specifically a section in Mutianyu, during a clear autumn day, with annotations detailing its watchtowers, construction materials, and strategic importance.

The third image should present the Colosseum in Rome, Italy, bathed in morning light, with annotations identifying its arches, seating tiers, and its role as an ancient amphitheater.

The fourth image should capture the Taj Mahal in Agra, India, under a soft, ethereal pre‑dawn glow, with annotations pointing out its marble dome, minarets, and inlaid floral designs.

Each image should be rendered with exceptional detail, vibrant colors, and dynamic lighting to emphasize the grandeur of the location, making the annotations seamlessly integrated into the visual narrative.

### No. 162: Hand-drawn infographic card about long-term IP building

![Language-ZH](https://img.shields.io/badge/Language-ZH-blue)
![Raycast](https://img.shields.io/badge/🚀-Raycast_Friendly-purple)

#### 📖 Description

A detailed prompt for creating a 9:16 hand-drawn infographic card with brush script Chinese text and simple illustrations, themed around the long-term compounding of building a personal IP.

#### 📝 Prompt

```
Create a hand-drawn style infographic card in a 9:16 vertical ratio. The card should have a clear theme, with a beige or off‑white paper-textured background and an overall rustic, friendly hand-drawn aesthetic.

At the top of the card, highlight the title in large brush-style cursive Chinese characters using a striking red-and-black contrast to draw the viewer’s eye. All text should be in Chinese cursive script. The layout is divided into 2 to 4 clear sections, each using short, concise Chinese phrases to express the key points. The font should maintain the flowing rhythm of cursive script while staying readable and artistic.

Add simple, fun hand-drawn illustrations or icons on the card, such as characters or symbolic motifs, to enhance visual appeal and spark reflection and empathy. Maintain visual balance in the overall layout and leave enough white space so the design remains clean, easy to read, and easy to understand.

The theme is: “{argument name="theme" default="Building a personal IP is a long-term compounding process; if you keep showing up daily and continue consistently, you will definitely see results, because 99% of people can’t stick with it."}”
```

### No. 178: Monochrome cinematic portrait of young woman

![Language-EN](https://img.shields.io/badge/Language-EN-blue)

#### 📖 Description

A structured JSON-style prompt describing an ultra-realistic monochrome portrait of a young woman with minimalist background and cinematic lighting.

#### 📝 Prompt

```
A cinematic, ultra-realistic monochrome portrait of a young woman with expressive eyes and a calm, intense gaze. She has short, dark, neatly styled hair; striking eyes with reflective highlights and a highly expressive look; a fair complexion with subtle freckles and realistic texture; and softly defined, naturally shaped lips. Her expression is calm and intense, with a direct gaze. She wears black clothing with a white textured collar that creates strong contrast. The background is a smooth monochrome gradient, minimalist and drawing focus to her face. Use soft but high-contrast monochrome lighting, with gentle highlights on facial features and subtle shadow depth, creating a cinematic, clean, refined effect. Frame it as a close-up portrait, ultra-realistic and high-resolution with a fine tonal range, sharp focus on the eyes and facial details, and a smooth background gradient. The overall aesthetic is minimalist, artistic, and elegant, with high texture detail, crisp monochrome rendering, and premium realism.

### No. 185: YouTube thumbnail design brief for a masked interview video

![Language-JA](https://img.shields.io/badge/Language-JA-blue)
![Raycast](https://img.shields.io/badge/🚀-Raycast_Friendly-purple)

#### 📖 Description

A long, detailed prompt asking the AI to design a high-conversion YouTube thumbnail using a masked character from a reference image, focusing on layout, text, and target audience.

#### 📝 Prompt

```
This is a YouTube thumbnail where, on the right side, there is an image of a person wearing a white mask being interviewed.
Using this aesthetic, I want to share the information architecture for the thumbnail with the AI and have it create the thumbnail, so please think of a prompt.

The reference image is only for the masked person on the right ({argument name="character_name_en" default="Eru"}); use that as the reference, and make the layout, text size, and design so that the click-through rate is maximized.

The target audience is men in their {argument name="target_age_range_en" default="late 20s to 30s"} who struggle with communication skills.

# Thumbnail information architecture
<Left side>
Three layers of conversation (small)
Express them as an inverted triangle
Divide into three colors
In reality, from top to bottom, the following three (blur the text):
・Abstract
・Facts
・Concrete

<Right side>
{argument name="character_name_en_again" default="Eru"} (the masked person)
“This is all there is to conversation” (put this in a speech bubble)

<Bottom>
“With this,
conversations go on forever” (stretch across the full width)
```
